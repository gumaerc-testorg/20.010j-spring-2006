description: The BioMEMS lab at Whitehead Institute has developed a device that makes
  DNA sequencing faster, more accurate, and exponentially less expensive. The chip-based
  device miniaturizes a process called electrophoresis onto a small glass chip. In
  operation, samples of DNA are injected in microchannels etched onto the chip?s surface,
  and an electrical current separates the DNA molecules based on their size. (Image
