  caption: The BioMEMS lab at {{% resource_link "fcc929b0-dcf2-442f-a0ce-5709ba16cbe9"
    "Whitehead Institute" %}} has developed a device that makes DNA fingerprinting
    faster, more accurate, and portable. The chip-based device miniaturizes a process
    called electrophoresis onto a small glass chip. In operation, samples of DNA are
    injected in microchannels etched onto the chip's surface, and an electrical current
    separates the DNA molecules based on their size. (Image by {{% resource_link "11259ace-e9a6-40cb-b33a-dd90ebeabe00"
